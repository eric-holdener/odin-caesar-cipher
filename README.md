# odin-caesar-cipher

This project posed by the odin project was to create one of the simplest ciphers, the caesar cipher, in programming.

To accomplish a case sensitive shift cipher, i converted the characters into their relevant ascii code, separated them by uppercase and lowercase through if statements, and then added logic to determine if there was wrapping around that needed to be done. Overall a good thought experiment, nothing that wasnt covered in foundations and the ruby programming I have done in the course already.

This was a good programming task to get my feet wet creating my own projects in ruby, as opposed to working off of just a predetermined set of exercises.

One way to definitely improve this is improve my test writing ability, as I'm sure there are some edge cases I am currently missing but do not know about. Once I finish the odin project overall, I plan on coming back to all my projects, reflecting on my growth, and refactoring them into something that can be utilized in a personal website, so I will write proper tests and refactor the code then. Until then, I am quite happy with this!
